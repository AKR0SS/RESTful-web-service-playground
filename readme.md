# REST API

This is a repository to learn how to build RESTful web API's. I first touched API's while building the [API wrapper Taki](https://github.com/AKR0SS/Taki-MAL-API-Wrapper) for [Kumiko](https://github.com/akr0ss/kumiko-discord-bot). Working on an API wrapper peaked my interest in learning more about how the inner workings of how my favourite game stat websites work behind the scenes and how web API's are created for some of my favourite games.
